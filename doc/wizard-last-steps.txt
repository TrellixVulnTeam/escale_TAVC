You will have to choose a name for the current configuration and a client name.
They can be identical. 
However care should be taken in specifying a different name on each of the clients
that synchronize together over the same relay repository.

For example, if you want to synchronize a folder between two computers, one computer
could choose ``client-1`` as a name below and the other ``client-2``:

.. parsed-literal::

	Choose a name for this configuration section.
	Prefer ascii names.
	Section name (required): :strong:`client-1` |enter|
	Choose a client name.
	The client name should uniquely identify the client among all the nodes
	that operate on the same relay repository.
	Prefer ascii names.
	Client name: [poincare] |enter|

If you want to encrypt the data before they are sent to the relay storage, you will
need to share a same encryption key between all the clients that synchronize over
the same relay repository.

The first client to be set-up can generate a key. 
This key will be available in a file that can be copied into the other clients.

The first client would perform the following steps:

.. parsed-literal::

	Encryption: [on] |enter|
	Passphrase filename [x.credential]: |enter|
	'/home/poincare/.config/escale/x.credential' file does not exist yet
	Generate a new key? [Y/n] |enter|
		key: b'_0Uozrh6S6RJ0ybOlJvZWreGFl6NffMUbU8xGvZ5QJw='

while the others would get a copy of the generated file - here called ``x.credential`` - 
and perform the following steps:

.. parsed-literal::

        Encryption: [on] |enter|
        Passphrase filename [y.credential]: :strong:`x.credential` |enter|

In the above example, the file is expected to be in the current directory or the configuration directory. 
You can alternatively specify a filepath.

The wizard will suggest default filenames based on the type of relay.
``x.credential`` and ``y.credential`` are fictive values and all clients would most probably be suggested the exact same name.

.. note:: A passphrase file is not a text file. 

	Especially, the passphrase stored in it should not be followed by a newline or carriage return character, 
	otherwise these trailing characters would be included in the passphrase. 

.. important:: Passphrases are private and should not be sent in plain emails. 
	Consider encrypted emails or services like `onetimesecret.com`_. 

	Pay special attention not to introduce newline or carriage return while editing a passphrase file.

You are then requested to specify in which mode synchronize should operate:

.. parsed-literal::

	Synchronization mode can be 'upload', 'download', 'shared' or 'conservative' 
		. 'upload': your local files will be sent to the relay repository
		            your local files will not be modified
		. 'download': you will get files from the relay repository
		              your local files will not be sent over the internet
	        	      but they can be modified
		. 'shared': your files will be fully synchronized
		. 'conservative': your local files will be sent to the relay repository
	        	          but will not be modified
	                	  you will get only new files from the relay repository
	Which mode for this client?: [shared] |enter|

More information about synchronization modes can be found in `this page <usage.html#synchronization-modes>`_.

Especially, if you want to implement a simple backup setup, you may have two clients: 

* the one that accommodates the active data will be set in *upload* mode, 
* the other one that accommodates the backup copy will be set in *download* mode.


The last few steps are straightforward:

.. parsed-literal::

	Refresh interval (in seconds): [10] |enter|
	Quotas on the amount of sent data are recommended for pushers
	 examples:  2GB  4.5G  1To  (default unit is gigabyte)
	Disk quota: [] :strong:`1` |enter|
	Do you want to add/edit another section? [N/y] |enter|

Setting disk quota to ``1`` will make |escale| use no more than one gigabyte in your Dropbox space.
