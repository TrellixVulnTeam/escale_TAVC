If you want to encrypt the data before they are sent to the relay storage, you will
need to share a same encryption key between all the clients that synchronize over
the same relay repository.

The first client to be set up can generate a key. 
This key will be available in a file that can be copied into the other clients.

The first client would perform the following steps:

.. parsed-literal::

	Encryption: [on] |enter|
	Passphrase filename [my-first-repository.passphrase]: |enter|
	'$HOME/.config/escale/my-first-repository.passphrase' file does not exist yet
	Generate a new key? [Y/n] |enter|
		key: b'_0Uozrh6S6RJ0ybOlJvZWreGFl6NffMUbU8xGvZ5QJw='

while the others would get a copy of the generated file - here called ``x.passphrase`` - 
and perform the following steps:

.. parsed-literal::

        Encryption: [on] |enter|
        Passphrase filename [my-first-repository.passphrase]: |enter|

In the above example, the ``my-first-repository.passphrase`` file is expected to be in the current directory or the configuration directory. 
You can alternatively specify a filepath.

.. note:: A passphrase file is not a text file. 

	Especially, the passphrase stored in it should not be followed by a newline or carriage return character, 
	otherwise these trailing characters would be included in the passphrase. 

.. important:: Passphrases are private and should not be sent in plain emails. 
	Consider encrypted emails or services like `onetimesecret.com`_. 

	Pay special attention not to introduce newline or carriage return while editing a passphrase file.

You are then requested to specify in which mode synchronize should operate:

.. parsed-literal::

	Synchronization mode can be 'upload', 'download', 'shared' or 'conservative' 
	Request help with '?'
	Which mode for this client? [shared] |enter|

More information about synchronization modes can be found in `this page <usage.html#synchronization-modes>`_.

Especially, if you want to implement a simple backup setup, you may have two clients: 

* the one that accommodates the active data will be set in *upload* mode, 
* the other one that accommodates the backup copy will be set in *download* mode.


The next few steps are straightforward:

.. parsed-literal::

	Refresh interval (in seconds): [10] |enter|
	Request help with '?'
	Disk quota: [] :strong:`1` |enter|

Setting disk quota to ``1`` will make |escale| use no more than one gigabyte in your Dropbox space.

Note that larger files will not be transferred due to insufficient space, as long as |escale| does not feature automatic split-and-recombine mechanics.
This value should be large enough so that your files can be piped through. It can be arbitrarily large but will usually be smaller that the available storage space.
