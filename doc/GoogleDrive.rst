Google Drive
============

To synchronize your data using |googledrive| as a relay storage, you should first make a new directory to accommodate the relay repository.

To synchronize using this remote directory, you have two options:

* you can either mount your |googledrive| storage space in your local file system with an external tool (see the `Local mount`_ section)
* or you can use the |googledrive| backend provided in |escale| (see the `Synchronizing with drive`_)
