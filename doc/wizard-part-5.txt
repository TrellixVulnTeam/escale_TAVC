Exit the configuration wizard:

.. parsed-literal::

	Do you want to add/edit another section? [N/y] |enter|


Your client is ready and can be launched with:

.. parsed-literal::

	$ :strong:`escalectl start`

You can make your terminal continuously flush the logs with:

.. parsed-literal::

	$ :strong:`tail -f ~/.config/escale/escale.log`


Beware that the `escalectl stop` command does not work properly on |windows|. It actually kills all the Python processes instead of stopping |escale| only.
