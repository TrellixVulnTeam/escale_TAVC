Yandex.Disk
===========

|escale| can operate with the Yandex.Disk WebDAV server at webdav.yandex.ru.

.. include:: wizard-part-1.txt

You have to choose a name for the directory that will accommodate the relay repository. 
Here we choose ``Escale Repository`` as a name:

.. parsed-literal::

	Is the relay repository locally mounted in the file system? [N/y] |enter|
	Request help with '?'
        Address of the relay repository (required): :strong:`https://webdav.yandex.ru/Escale Repository` |enter|

Note that you will need to manually make this directory, for example from the web interface to your `Yandex.Disk space <https://disk.yandex.ru/client/disk>`_.
